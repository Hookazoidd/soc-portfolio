# SOC Analyst Portfolio

This repository contains SOC-style investigation tickets.

My goal is to show how I handle a security alert in a clear, repeatable way: identify what happened, validate it with logs, document evidence, and decide whether it’s a false positive, true positive, or needs escalation.

I’m targeting a SOC Level 1 role, with a strong interest in incident response.
